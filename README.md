# WhatDayIsIt
Attempt to build a simple React-Native app for my son so he knows what day it is :-)

This app uses https://github.com/GeekyAnts/react-native-easy-grid

Many Thanks

## Running

Before running the application ensure that the JavaScript bundling service is running in a separate tab:

```shell
npm run start -- --reset-cache
```

## iOS

```shell
react-native run-ios
```
